<h1>The Application</h1>

<ul>
<li>The Shiny application developed for the Capstone assignment predicts the next word in a series of word provided by the user. A model was trained using a corpus of news, blogs and twitter data. </li>
<li>
<li>The Slidify presentation pitch can be found <a href="https://bluebonobo.github.io/coursera_hopkins_developingdataproducts/">here</a> </li>
<li>The Shiny application can be found <a href="https://bluebonobo.shinyapps.io/week4shinyapp/">here</a> </li>
</ul>


<h1>Application Structure, Source code and Model</h1>

<ul>
<li>The calculation done on the server are located in the file server.R locate in github <a href="https://github.com/bluebonobo/coursera_hopkins_developingdataproducts/tree/main/week4/week4ShinyApp">here</a></li>
<li>The application build one linear regression model per cut quality</li>
<li>Each model is then represented with its error on the scatter plot</li>
<li>Models can be isolated by selected the type of cut in the legend</li>
<li>THe model will be statistical based on a n-grams approach <a href="https://towardsai.net/p/nlp/how-do-language-models-predict-the-next-word">see this article</a></li>
</ul>
